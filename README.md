# mac-kb-on-ubuntu
A bit of scripts to allow me to switch between a Mac BT keyboard's layout and my default. 

I run the Mac KB script in its own terminal by running the bash shortcut `kbmac`, which runs on its own repeatedly to make sure the layout doesn't change as X11 does its thing in the background and that way I don't have to think so hard about layouts.

p.s. In Xmodmap, there's an extra bit to recapture the homekey as escape since my keyboard was a clone that _almost_ is the same as the mini Apple BT keyboards.
